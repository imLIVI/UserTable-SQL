# UserTable-SQL
### Description
1. Write a script for creating a table with parameters:
* table name — ```PERSONS```;
* it contains 5 columns — ```name```, ```surname```, ```age```, ```phone_number```, ```city_of_living```;
* the **primary key** will be a combination of ```name```, ```surname```, ```age```.
2. Write a script that will search in the ```PERSONS``` table for the name and surname fields of users who live in ```MOSCOW```.
3. Write a script that will search in the ```PERSONS``` table for all fields that have an age field above 27 years. Sort the results in descending 
order of age.

As a result, you should have three script files with the SQL extension. Put the written scripts in a separate repository on GitHub and attach a link 
to it in the homework comment.
